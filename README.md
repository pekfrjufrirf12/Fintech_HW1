Company name: Aspiration
Founding Date: 2013
Founders: Andrei Cherny, Joseph N. Sanberg
Went public in 2021 in a $2.3 billion merger with InterPrivate III Financial Partners Inc., a special purpose acquisition company. The deal provided $400 million in net cash, $258.75 million of restricted cash held in trust and $200 million fully committed common stock.
Aspiration is part of the neobank sector. The neobank sector can be described as a disruption to older, more established banks. They do not offer as wide a scope of banking services as a brick-and-mortar bank, but the advantages of such are that they are able to serve a niche of younger digital natives, focus on providing checking and savings accounts paying higher interest rates, and lower fees due to lower overhead costs.
Many neobanks are not chartered banks but have enough FDIC insurance covering their services to operate. For example, Aspiration offers a spend and save account which combines a debit card and a savings account yielding 2%.
